This document is intended only as a notes page for the team.
Things we need:

Template (header, nav, and footer)
Home page

Pets up for adoption (Consider grid format, should comprise of blocks that detail age, species, estimated birthday and age, and sex)
Stories (Pargraphs of creative writing about animal rescue, should include links to donations and adoptions pages afterwords)
Donations page (State where the donations go, 501c3 status, and anchor select boxes for pre-determined amounts, and a text field for custom amount)
Animal Care Policy (Creative writing for animal care policy, and maybe a link to contact_us page in case they have questions)

About us (List our mission statement and team members)
Contact us (Address, phone number, email, Google maps link)

We will also need to upload 1 site map and 1 wireframe of the home page.
